<section>

    <p>This guide is an introduction to basic and advanced concepts of the bash shell.</p>
    <p>It teaches both newcomers and long-time users the best, safest and most robust ways of writing powerful bash scripts as well as making efficient and speedy interactive use of the shell.</p>
    <p>This guide has gone through several iterations and is the result of a severe lack of consistent, clear and reliable language on the topic on the rest of the Internet as well as the public library or book stores.</p>
